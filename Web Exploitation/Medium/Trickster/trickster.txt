You need a simple webshell for this

php is being used, learned that from Wapanalyzer

uploding a file checks for png so i tried changing the extension and the upload works fine
but the server hates it because it can't find the png 
so i had to add the text "PNG" for it to pass the signature check then the shell works

used command "find / -name "*.txt" to look for the flag
