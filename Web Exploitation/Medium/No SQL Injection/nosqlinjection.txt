This one was new to me

I had to lookup how to even begin 

so when you look at the source code given with the challenge, you notice that the flag is going to get passed through a token

the source code will also provide an email address to use

when trying a random password with the email address gives no new error message

i saw that there's no sql injection payloads that you can use, i used one from hacktricks 

put that payload and it let me login and took me to an admin page

found no information in the admin page so i looked at the network tabs and found that in session storage it was storing a token in base64 and then decoded that base64 to find the flag
