This one was interesting because you have to dive deep

- Two ways to get started is one by using gobuster
- Look at the image directory on the site

The directory found is /secret/assets because that

navigate to that directory and then you will find a gif

the gif is being loaded from a folder hidden 

so now you know the directory path /secret/hidden/

Type that in and it will take you to a login page

inspect the site and you will notice there's a hidden element

You will notice another hidden directory called superhidden

navigate to /secret/hidden/superhidden and that will lead you to the flag
