mining your p and q's research paper

so this is where you start you look at the numbers

notice that the p is an even number

that means that it can be divisible by 2 another thing to do is watch out for the greatest command divisor 

now that you know one of the p and q, we can divide it by q

use the python script and then take the cipher text and use python to decrypt it

then you can use the script but after you take the number use xxd with the flags -r and -p to get teh flag
