This is interesting, i personally still don't understand how this works or why wireshark fails decrypting this
an alternatinve is ssldump so that might me worth looking into

in wireshark if you go to edit>preferences>in the rsa area

keep ip addr as any
port 443
protocol http
browse to the key file

then filter the http traffic 

follow the stream

the flag is in the request header
