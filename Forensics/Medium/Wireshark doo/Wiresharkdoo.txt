When you open the Wireshark pcap
there's a ton of HTTP packets so filter it with http
after that go through those packers, you will notice a GET packet 
This GET packet seems out of place so follow the stream
You will see something like this Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}

More like ROT-13 of it

ROT-13 means that the characters are exactly 13 letters apart
