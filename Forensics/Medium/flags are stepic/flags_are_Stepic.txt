So i hate myself for not getting this during the picoCTF

stepic is the clue word here and should have looked it up what it meant

I took the assumption that it would be just another steg challenge and went down a crazy route

but using stepic you can get to the flag easily

stepic -d -i upz.png -o flag.txt

-decode -input -output
